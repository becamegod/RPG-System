bugs:
title screen freeze, can't input: maybe because I presses A too soon
rumble won't stop after enhancing (not sure), have to disable rumble in the settings and enable it back up
Ramo disappears after the cutscene where beluga is missing
when there is an item info popup, and got caught by a squid, the popup hide the QTE

impression:
2d cutscene animation is weird (discrete framerate with smooth linear translation) but its variety is entertaining (a lot of unexpected cutscene, which is good)
dialogue font is not appealing (at first, but got used to it in the long run)
the game hooks after unlocking dive suit (upgrading)
everything done thru app is unnatural
i like bancho personality and dave getting bullied (comedy)
Harpoon QTE on gamepad is a nightmare (i have to enable auto QTE in the settings)
gun enhance is late, we expected it sooner
i like the girl characters, energetic and cute
i want to upgrade diving speed
swap the A and RT for harpoon (not sure)
im so surprised that the trigger harden on ps5 controller when harpooning
when i see the village, i knew there will be so much chores and i dont know what to do with Bei
after the village chapter, diving is less
upgrading melee weapon? at first i thought there wont be any, actually its late
ecowatcher lv3 is too long
option to keep the music playing thru phone
the dona turtle mission is unclear on how to calm it down
i like how cobra clap when i purchase
i like how sato entry (the sound)
the tea pouring and master chef simulation reminds me of my old game
i love how there are different minigames that keeps the game fresh like the momo cat following, the infiltration, the chef challenge
the decipher should have a auto clear threshold
maybe increase the camera wiping speed
recipe enhancing scrolling inconvenient, i have to do the good old workaround hehe
